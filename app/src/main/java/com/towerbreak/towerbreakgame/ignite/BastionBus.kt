/**
 * Process-wide hand-off for one-time push URLs, never persisted (one-time rule).
 *
 * Two cases, and they need different handling. A push that arrives while the shell is
 * on screen goes straight to [onWarmUrl]. A push the user taps while the app sits in
 * the background arrives at the launcher instead, and by then the shell has cleared
 * its callback — so the URL is [queue]d, the launcher draws nothing at all, and the
 * shell picks the URL up as it comes back. Drawing the splash for that would take the
 * page the user left off the screen for no reason.
