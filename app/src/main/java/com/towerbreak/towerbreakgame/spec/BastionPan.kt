/**
 * Keeps the focused field clear of the keyboard by sliding the WebView, never by
 * shortening it. Background and the failed alternatives: `.cursor/rules/kotlin_keyboard.mdc`.
 *
 * Shortening was the original sin. Taking height away from a WebView shrinks the
 * page's viewport, and the page answers with a burst of work in one go: it re-lays out,
 * scrolls the focused field into view against the layout it had a moment earlier, then
 * clamps that scroll to the layout that finally lands. The last two steps disagree, and
 * their disagreement is the flick — no amount of easing on this side could remove it,
 * because none of it was on this side.
 *
 * Sliding has none of that. The page keeps its full height and never reflows; the view
 * is moved by a transform, which costs one compositor frame. The strip left bare at the
 * bottom is always shorter than the keyboard, so the keyboard covers it.
 *
 * The other half of the job is making sure nothing else is moving the page at the same
 * time — see [withoutKeyboard], which is what keeps this class the only hand on the
 * wheel.
 *
 * Where the field is comes from the page itself, in device pixels — deliberately not as
 * a share of the page's viewport, because that viewport is exactly the thing that can
 * change out from under the measurement.
